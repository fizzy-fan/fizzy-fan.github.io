  <p>
    Dr. Fan works at the intersection of multimodal transportation, network modeling, and environmental health. 
    Her research centers on understanding the complex dynamics in multimodal transportation networks, 
    the health implications of cumulative thermal exposure of travelers, 
    and building a cyber-physical infrastructure to enhance safety and accessibility. 
    Her work has been published in high-impact journals such as <em>Sustainable Cities and Society</em> 
    and supported by over CAD $300,000 in competitive grants and awards.

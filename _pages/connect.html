        <p>
        I dedicate one hour each week to connect with students ‚Äî undergraduate or graduate ‚Äî who would like support navigating academic or career challenges.

        <p>
        You do not need to be part of my research group or even at the University of Alberta. 
        I‚Äôm happy to offer guidance on topics such as graduate school, research development, fellowship applications, international study, or job planning.

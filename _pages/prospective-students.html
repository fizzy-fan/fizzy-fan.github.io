    <h2>About</h2>

    <h4>Mentoring Philosophy</h4>

    <p>
        I see my relationship with students in three forms: academic advisor, project supervisor, and professional mentor.
    </p>

    <h6>Academic Advisor</h6>
    <p>
        As an academic advisor, my ultimate goal for the Ph.D. program is to cultivate an independent scholar who becomes an expert in their own research topic, 
        which may be related to mine but substantially different. I expect you to be able to articulate a scientifically rigorous,
        practically sound, and methodologically novel research question. Then, you will need to independently (with my advice) 
        develop your research program to test your hypotheses and defend it in front of a group of established scholars. 
        I don’t set hard expectations on publication numbers, as I believe strong research output naturally follows when you focus on quality and clarity of thinking.
        During your first week in the group, we will meet to go over your goals and co-develop a timeline. 
        In a typical four-year trajectory, you will likely spend the first 1–2 years strengthening your fundamental knowledge, technical skills, 
        and academic communication, while working on projects more directly supervised by me. You will propose your dissertation topic 
        by the second year and defend in your fourth year.
    </p>

    <p>
        The goal of the MSc program is to cultivate an independent thinker who can quickly learn new ideas 
        and apply them to real-world challenges. You will be expected to systematically and independently develop a set of skills, 
        and apply them to a topic of your interest. You will write a thesis and defend your methodological choices in front of a group of established scholars.
        During your first week, we will meet to determine your course plan, timeline, and major milestones.
    </p>

    <h6>Project Supervisor</h6>
    <p>
        I understand that pursuing graduate study is a significant time and financial investment. 
        My baseline responsibility as a supervisor is to provide you with a supportive and financially secure learning environment.
        I make every effort to ensure reliable and sufficient funding for you throughout your program. 
        When you take on a Research Assistant role under my projects, I prefer to set clear expectations around communication, workload, and deliverables. 
        In general, I expect you to respect deadlines, be willing to learn and adapt, and stay open to feedback. 
        I am typically flexible regarding your working location and schedule, as long as you meet project goals on time. 
    </p>

    <h6>Professional Mentor</h6>
    <p>
        As a mentor, I support your professional and personal growth.
        Depending on your career goals, I generally expect you to complete 1–2 semesters of TA-ship, with flexibility based on your interests and needs. 
        I support students in pursuing internships, and for those exploring academic careers, I offer mentorship in fellowship applications, 
        soft skills development, networking, and the job search process. 
        Ultimately, I aim to develop systematic coaching materials for students aspiring to academic careers. 
        I tend to be particularly understanding and supportive in the case of unexpected setbacks, 
        and I am dedicated to support my students through their personal developments and growth.

    <h4>University of Alberta</h4>

    <p>
    The University of Alberta is one of Canada’s leading research universities, 
    consistently ranked among the top institutions nationally and internationally. 
    Located in Edmonton, Alberta’s capital city, the university offers world-class facilities, 
    a vibrant intellectual community, and strong support for graduate student development. 
    The province of Alberta is known not only for its innovation in energy, health, and environmental research, 
    but also for its stunning natural beauty. Just a few hours from campus lies <strong>Banff National Park</strong>, 
    one of the most breathtaking mountain regions in the world—an ideal getaway for hiking, skiing, or simply reconnecting with nature. 
    Studying here offers the rare combination of academic rigor and access to awe-inspiring landscapes that can renew your perspective and creativity 
    (below are a few photos that I took last year).

    <b>The THRIVIN' Group at the University of Alberta is hiring 1-2 highly motivated MSc/PhD students 
    in Transportation Engineering to join in Winter/Fall 2026</b>.
    Should you become a member of us, you will work under the supervision of Dr. Huiying ("Fizzy") Fan
    (learn more about Fizzy <a href="{{ '/people/' | relative_url }}">here</a>),
    and work collaboratively with 1-2 more PhD students soon to join the team.
    The team is building an innovative and interdisciplinary research program to solve the 
    sustainability and resilience challenges in urban transportation through investigating the emerging properties
    in complex transportation networks and building cyber-physical systems to enhance our system
    (learn more about our research <a href="{{ '/research/' | relative_url }}">here</a>).
</p>
<p>
    The MSc program includes 2-3 years of research funding ($32,000/year) and 
    the PhD program includes 4-5 years of research funding ($38,000/year). 
    You will have the chance to participate in 1-2 domestic and/or international conferences 
    each year with full travel fund covered.

<h2>About</h2>

<h4>Mentoring Philosophy</h4>

<p>
    I see my relationship with students in three forms: academical advisor, project supervisor, and professional mentor.
</p>
<h6>Academic Advisor</h6>
<p>
    As an academic advisor, my ultimate goal of the Ph.D. program is to cultivate an independent scholar who becomes an expert in their own topic of research, 
    which may be related to mine but substaintially different. I expect you to be able to articulate a scientifically rigorous,
    practically sound, and methodologically novel research question. Then, you will need to independently (though wtih my advice)
    develop your research program to test the hypotheses and defend it in front of a group of established scholars. 
    I don't have hard expectations on the numbers, as I believe numbers naturally come as you move towards passing your defense.
    The first week you join the team, we will have a meeting to go over your goals and propose a timeline. 
    In a typical 4 year timeline, you will likely use the first 1-2 years to strengthen your fundamental knowledge, technical skills,
    academic communiation skills, while taking on projects that are more heavily supervised by me. You will propose your dissertation topic
    by the second year and defend in your fourth year.
</p>
<p>
    The goal of the MSc program is to cultivate an independent thinker who is able to learn quickly for any topics of investigation, 
    and apply them to real-world challenges. You will need to be able to systematically and independently learn a set of skills,
    and apply them to a topic of your interest. You will need to write a thesis and defend your choice of methods in front of a group of established scholars.
    The first week you join the team, we will have a meeting to decide on your course plan, timeline, and major milestones. 
</p>
<h6>Project Supervisor</h6>
<p>
    I understand that the pursuit of graduate study is a significant time and financial investment. 
    The basic goal of me as a supervisor is to provide you with a comfortable and financially healthy learning environment.
    I spare no efforts in ensuring secure and sufficient funding for you throughout the years. 
    When you are taking on Research Assistant role under my projects, I prefer to set clear boundaries in our communication 
    in terms of your workload and delivery expectations. In general, I expect you to respect deadlines, 
    be willing to learn and adapt, and be open to feedback. I tend to be flexible in terms of your working locationa and schedule, 
    as long as you deliver on time. 
</p>
<h6>Professional Mentor</h6>
<p>
    As a mentor, I support your professional and personal growth.
    Depending on your career goal, I expect you to take on 1-2 semesters of TA-ship, with the option for more or less per your request and needs.
    I support students in pursuit of internships. If you would like to explore academic jobs, 
    I will mentor you through your career development, including but not limited to fellowship applications, soft skills development, networking, job search, etc. 
    Ultimately, I aim to develop systematic coaching materials for students aiming at academic jobs. 
    I tend to be particularly understanding and supportive in the case of unexpected setbacks, 
    and I am dedicated to support my students through their personal developments and growth.

<h4>University of Alberta</h4>

<p>
  The University of Alberta is one of Canada’s leading research universities, 
  consistently ranked among the top institutions nationally and internationally. 
  Located in Edmonton, Alberta’s capital city, the university offers world-class facilities, 
  a vibrant intellectual community, and strong support for graduate student development. 
  The province of Alberta is known not only for its innovation in energy, health, and environmental research, 
  but also for its stunning natural beauty. Just a few hours from campus lies <strong>Banff National Park</strong>, 
  one of the most breathtaking mountain regions in the world—an ideal getaway for hiking, skiing, or simply reconnecting with nature. 
  Studying here offers the rare combination of academic rigor and access to awe-inspiring landscapes that can renew your perspective and creativity 
  (below are a few photos that I took last year).
